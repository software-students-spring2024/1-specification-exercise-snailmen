## Stakeholders

### Harlan Wise:

#### Goals/Needs

* Bonus points for words that are not part of the answer

* Controls are smooth and not fiddly or unintuitive

* Monetized features ADD to the game

* Hints

* Customizable cosmetics

#### Problems/Frustrations

* Unpleasant monetization strategies that disrupt the experience (freemium-type things where not paying makes your gameplay experience markedly worse)

* Pausing background media to play its own sound

* Bad music/sound effects

* Ugly/inaccessible (ex. red/green) graphics

* Stressful limited-time events

## Product Vision Statement

A mobile game where the player is given an assortment of letters that constitute a set of scrambled words and aims to reconstruct the original words.
